# Complete Sorting and Pagination Functionality

• Implement full multi-column sorting (name, experience, location, degree) with direction control
• Add server-side pagination with efficient data loading and page controls
• Integrate search, sort, and pagination with optimized API calls
• Add visual sort indicators and smooth pagination transitions
• Achieve 7-25ms API response times with proper database query optimization

This completes the core functionality by connecting the UI foundation with the database layer for production-ready data operations.
