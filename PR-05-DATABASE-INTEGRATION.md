# PostgreSQL Database Integration

• Replace mock data with full PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM
• Add Docker Compose setup for local development
• Implement type-safe database schema with proper healthcare data structure
• Create realistic seed data with 15+ advocate profiles
• Configure database migrations and connection management

This transforms the application from mock data to production-ready database layer with proper type safety and realistic healthcare advocate data.
