# Foundation Setup - Sorting and Pagination Infrastructure

• Add foundational sorting state management with field and direction controls
• Implement pagination state with page navigation and size configuration
• Establish clean React patterns for complex data operations
• Prepare infrastructure for server-side database integration

This establishes the core state management foundation before adding database complexity, making subsequent PRs easier to review and test.
